# RegExp-Golf

Connor Ring Ch. 9 Code
March 24th, 2015

This repo is meant to complete the RegExp Golf exercise in Chapter 9. My thought was that it will scan the strings in each call of "verify", checking to see if the expression that I dictate is within these strings. It will then print out a line of expression that doesn't work out. So far, I have not been able to get a successful print, but I was able to get the program to at least recognize that the strings don't match the expression.

The code runs on node. D8 does not work.
